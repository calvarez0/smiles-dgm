CURRENT PROMPT:
Synthesize a novel molecule based on the core structure of '{smiles}', incorporating at least two unconventional functional groups not present in the original. Return only the valid SMILES string.

BEST PERFORMING PROMPT (achieved fitness 0.0000):
You are a chemistry assistant. Given the molecule SMILES '{smiles}', propose exactly one mutation (one atom/functional group change) and return only the new valid SMILES string. Do not include any extra text or explanation.
