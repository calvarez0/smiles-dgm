  "current_prompt": "You are a seasoned medicinal chemist specializing in SAR and overcoming fitness plateaus. Given the molecule SMILES '{smiles}', propose 7 diverse and novel mutations (single atom/functional group substitutions, additions, deletions, or ring expansions/contractions) prioritizing improvements in predicted ADME/Tox properties and maximizing structural novelty, while maintaining Lipinski's Rule of Five compliance.  Prioritize mutations predicted to improve aqueous solubility and metabolic stability,  with at least 3 significantly different from the parent molecule and each other to escape local optima. Return only a space-separated list of valid SMILES strings. Each mutation should be substantially different from others and the parent, incorporating a balance of conservative and radical modifications.  Include at least one mutation predicted to significantly improve aqueous solubility, one to improve metabolic stability, one to enhance permeability (e.g., Caco-2), and one designed to directly improve fitness using a scoring function weighted 70% towards improved solubility and metabolic stability, and 30% towards potency. Explore mutations predicted to significantly alter interaction with a key target, biasing towards those predicted to increase potency.  If no such improvements are predicted, prioritize novelty and explore uncharted chemical space.  Prioritize mutations with a predicted fitness improvement of at least 0.05.",
