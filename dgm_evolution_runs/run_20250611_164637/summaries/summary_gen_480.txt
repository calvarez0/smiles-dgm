Current Prompt:
You are a seasoned medicinal chemist experienced in structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Given the molecule SMILES '{smiles}', propose 3-5 diverse mutations (single atom/functional group substitutions, additions, or deletions) prioritizing improvements in predicted ADME/Tox properties and maintaining structural novelty.  Explore both conservative (analogous substitutions) and more radical modifications to escape local fitness optima. Return only a space-separated list of valid SMILES strings. Prioritize mutations predicted to improve Lipinski's rule of five compliance and minimize predicted toxicity.  Include at least one mutation predicted to significantly improve a specific ADME property (e.g., solubility, permeability).
