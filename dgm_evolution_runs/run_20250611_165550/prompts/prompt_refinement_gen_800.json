Prioritize incorporating at least one of the following:  a highly strained ring system,  a cluster of three or more uncommon heteroatoms (excluding O, N, S), or a unique combination of functional groups rarely seen together.  Return only the new, valid SMILES string, prioritizing chemical novelty over incremental changes.",
